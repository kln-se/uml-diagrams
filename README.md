# 1. What's inside?

The application programming interface (API) of a web-based application which is designed to handle the processing of UML diagrams in the form of JSON.

The API supports:
- Store, retrieve, update, delete and copy created UML diagrams;
- Share UML diagrams to other users with different permissions.

# 2. How to run

## 2.1 Basic run (dev. purpose or getting started)

2.1.1. Proceed to the directory where the project should be placed:
```commandline
cd <path-to-directory>
```
2.1.2. Clone the project content from the repository inside this directory:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/<github-user>/<repository-name>.git
```
2.1.3. Create virtual environment:
```commandline
python -m venv venv
```
2.1.4. Activate created virtual environment (Windows):
```commandline
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
2.1.5. Install requirements:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2.1.6. Provide `.env` file to the project root folder with the following variables:
```env
# Django
SECRET_KEY=<some-secret-key>
# Should be overridden when running container like "docker run ... -e DJANGO_DEBUG_MODE=False"
DJANGO_DEBUG_MODE=True

# CORS allowed host & port details for config/settings.py
CORS_ALLOWED_HOST=<some-host>
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://<some-host>:<some-port>

# Basic superuser (admin) account for the application
SUPERUSER_EMAIL=<some-superuser-email>
SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=<some-superuser-password>

# User role to interact with the database on behalf of the application itself
# This role is created in deploy/db/user_permissions.sql during postgres image build (see deploy/db/Dockerfile)
DB_USER=<some-username>
DB_PASSWORD=<some-password>
DB_NAME=<some-database-name>
# For docker it will be set to the docker postgres container name via ENV var in Dockerfile and "docker run  -e DB_HOST=..." command
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# PostgreSQL
# Creating basic superuser and init. database for postgres docker container
# About postgres init env. vars see at https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres
POSTGRES_USER=<some-username>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<some-password>
POSTGRES_DB=<some-database-name>
```
2.1.6.1. By the default the PostgreSQL database will be used.
*It is assumed that the official postgres image from dockerhub is used.*

Basic docker commands to manage PostgreSQL database inside the docker container can be found in `docker-script.ps1`.

So it is necessary to provide the environment variables listed above for the database connection.
To switch back to the SQLite database, it is necessary to set `default` key in the `DATABASES` dictionary in `config/settings.py` file for sqlite3 engine:
```python
DATABASES = {
    "postgres": {
        ...
    },
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    },
}
```
2.1.6.2. Variables `SUPERUSER_EMAIL` and `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` are used by migration script `0002_create_superuser.py` to create the superuser account for the application.
This account is used as basic admin account for the application and can be used to get access to the admin panel.
2.1.7. Apply database migrations:
```commandline
python manage.py migrate
```
2.1.8. **(Optional)** Ð¡onfigure the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings in your `settings.py` file by adding the domain(s) of your front-end application to the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` lists.
For example:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    "localhost",
]

CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",
]
```
2.1.9. Run django project:
```commandline
python manage.py runserver <port>
```

## 2.2. Deploy

2.2.1 To deploy the project to the server you can use the following command:
```shell
docker-compose --env-file .env up -d
```
2.2.2. Manual preparation (optional)

Upon the start of the application container, the `entrypoint.sh` script will be executed.
During this process, the database migrations will be automatically applied, and static files will be collected.
However, it is also possible to perform these actions manually, as follows:

2.2.2.1. Apply database migrations:
```shell
docker exec uml-diagrams-api python manage.py migrate
```
2.2.2.2. Collect static files:
```shell
docker exec uml-diagrams-api python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

# 3. How to use

See documentation for the API after running the project at:
- *.yaml doc:
  - `http:/<ip-address>:<port>/schema`;
- Optional UI:
  - `http:/<ip-address>:<port>/schema/swagger-ui/`;
  - `http:/<ip-address>:<port>/schema/redoc/`.
